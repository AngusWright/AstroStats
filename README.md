# Viewing the Lecture Notes 
The lecture notes are provided in viewable-on-github format by clicking on the various "markdown" (.md) files in the main directory (i.e. directly above this description). Additionally, the lectures can be downloaded and compiled into a range of formats using the knit.sh script in the Rmd folder. Available formats are: 

- HTML: produces html notes in the rmdformats::downcute style 
- PDF: produces PDF lecture notes 
- Slidy: produces slides for live-lecturing 
- github: produces the viewable-on-github markdown documents above
